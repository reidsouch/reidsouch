My name is Reid Souchereau. I am currently a Master's Student in Industrial Engineering at _The_ Ohio State University :chestnut: and have a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from _The_ Ohio State University. I am a graduate reasearch associate in the 
__[Spine Research Institute](https://spine.osu.edu/)__ working with:

  - Spine biomechanical modeling
  - Machine learning for sensor inputs and 3D modeling of personalized spines 
  - Assessment of industrial exoskeletons
  
I am interested in pursing a career in research or applied data science within the realm of biomechanics, medical robotics, or branching into the space industry. I have an extensive background in MATLAB, and now transitioning into Python. I also have basic experience with other languages such as Java and R. I plan on documenting some of my research projects, alongside other python side projects.
